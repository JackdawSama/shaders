# The Shader Repository

This is a repository which I'm using to learn GLSL and practice shaders. 

The following repository follows a certain pattern. "Shader <Number>.glsl" is the learning file and "Shader <Number> Final.glsl" is the final file.
That's cool but what's the difference between the two ?
  
### The Learning File
These files are basically step by step learning of the whole shader. It has a ton of comments which are like personal notes. Apart from this there are a bunch of commented
out code as well which basically are previous versions of how it was written and then simplified. The most efficient and simplified code is that which is not commented.
  
### The Final File
The final file is purely just the simplified and efficient code that's written with a few comments.

### Shader Previews

Note: Previews might be updated then and there but I try to do that.
